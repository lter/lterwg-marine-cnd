## Project Summary

- https://lternet.edu/working-groups/marine-consumer-nutrient-dynamics/


## Guidelines for sharing scripts

- All code should include sufficient annotation and documentation so that other users can understand and run the scripts 
- Use RStudio projects to manage working directory
- Write your scripts such that other users can run the code without modifications. Keep file paths and other variables that might need to be changed at the beginning of the script, just after attaching the necessary libraries
- Check out the Scientific Computing Teamâ€™s best practice tips for [storing file paths](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/best_practices.html#file-paths)
- Include an attribution header to your scripts or Rmarkdown documents

Example:

```r
## ---------------------------
##
## Script name: 
##
## Purpose of script:
##
## Author: 
##
## Email: 
##
## ---------------------------

library(tidyverse)

```
