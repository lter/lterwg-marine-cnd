#most of the longterm consumer data comes from the fall monitoring efforts
#how does grasshopper differ from some of the planthoppers, have crabhole data bc we have something like 10 different crab speces
#hard to do abundance bc they scatter, crabholes as proxy for these sorts of things
#porewater nutrients with associated crabhole densities

# project doesnt do porewater monitoring, but they do surface water (org + inorg nutrients, temp, salinity, etc.)
# nutrient data collected quarterly on incoming or high tides
# project-specific porewater dataset and methods differ alot across sites potentially
# for eg, GCE has dataset but may be rather variable - everything up to 2021 or 2022 has been posted

# molluscs certainly have a CND effect - localized - these animals also change the elevation of the marsh
# crab hole data, not seeing a ton of effect so far
# littoraria - in part bc of how it effects the grazes, sort of like a lawnmower - in terms of nutrients, could really effect demand
# these are like small snails
# grasshoppers havent been thought of as huge good source
# Amanda suggests molluscs, littoraria, and crab hole
      # good relationships between crab hole size, and the size of the actual crab themselves
      # periwinkle snail - juvenile vs adult distinction, seem to be in bigger quadrats than fall monitoring density

# some crabs surface bioturbators, some rip up roots, and some burrow deeper - so effects on CND very contextual
# most of these crabs detritivores, and opportunistic omnivores
# zone - creek bank vs. mid marsh...represents how much tidal flooding, creek bank more snails - can climb up the grasses and mid-marsh more compacted,
# we see differences in dist. of snails due to geomorphology of marsh - see that for crabs, eg sand fiddler vs mud fiddler vs mud crabs - main reason while
# sampling across these zones to really get at hydrologic influeces in the salt marsh
# system is so structured by the hydrology - why CND little studied in these habitats, so dynamic

#Di lorio et al - salinity variation through time - would group by salinity instead of by sound and then grouping it by midmarsh vs creek bank

summary(mollusc_abund_GCE)#mollusc density ranging from 0-1092 ind/m2

# if for some of the species, were they targeted? eg mussels in mussel mound - sampling artifact, they are looking for mussels - maybe why such high max density
# if this applies, then likely just for the ribbed mussels
#melampus everywhere, while ribbed mussels are sort of patchy - for this mollusc data, may be worth pulling out sessile vs mobiles

# collecting all molluscs, and bringing them back to lab to process
